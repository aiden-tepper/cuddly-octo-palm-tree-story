There once was a young squirrel named Henry who loved to hang out in a big oak tree in a local neighborhood. He loved this oak tree and built a lovely house in it, where he lived by himself. He was often seen scurrying around the block finding acorns and bringing them up into his oak tree, where he would store them for later.
It was an beautiful day in October, when Henry found it. The most perfect acorn in the world. The minute he saw it, he knew he could not rest until it was added to his collection. He approached it cautiously and attempted to roll it over to his pile. However, the acorn was too big for him to roll it on his own. Henry was at a crossroads. He could ask for help from the other squirrels, but then he would risk one of them coveting HIS acorn.

But that caution was not enough. Suddenly, the acorn turned into a dragon!! "Oh no! What will I do?" wondered Henry. He decided to ride the dragon and before he knew it, the dragon took him
somewhere special. This special place was a different sort of land. It was a magical mystical forest that Henry was not used to. Henry was scared, and it was getting dark. So Henry decided that
he must find shelter quickly before it gets dangerous. It was his first time here. He did not know how dangerous it was.
