There once was a young squirrel named Henry who loved to hang out in a big oak tree in a local neighborhood. He loved this oak tree and built a lovely house in it, where he lived by himself. He was often seen scurrying around the block finding acorns and bringing them up into his oak tree, where he would store them for later.
It was an beautiful day in October, when Henry found it. The most perfect acorn in the world. The minute he saw it, he knew he could not rest until it was added to his collection. He approached it cautiously and attempted to roll it over to his pile. However, the acorn was too big for him to roll it on his own. Henry was at a crossroads. He could ask for help from the other squirrels, but then he would risk one of them coveting HIS acorn.
