There once was a young squirrel named Henry who loved to hang out in a big oak tree in a local neighborhood. He loved this oak tree and built a lovely house in it, where he lived by himself. He was often seen scurrying around the block finding acorns and bringing them up into his oak tree, where he would store them for later.
